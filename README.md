One of my first Unity games ever made to the end...
First version was made in 2018, found it while cleaning my disk

Features:
* Every time corridor configuration is completely random (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwMdxV-4C04)
* Monster can actually hear you and look for you
* Cool ps1 like graphics style (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3II4PpquXQ)

The first concept of the game was not actually about scp, but just walking in the infinite scary forest with no end(map literally had no end)
